If you are using Windows, git bash and my-SQL server 8.0 ---

(make sure the path to MySQL is updated in Path in System Environment variables)
now you can open git bash to connect to my-sql server like this --->

```cmd
winpty mysql -u root -p

(here root is the username , then it will prompt to password)

```mysql
show databases;
-- it will give list of all the databases present
```

```mysql
system cls; -- for windows to clear the o/p screen
system clear; -- for linux/mac to clear the o/p screen
```
